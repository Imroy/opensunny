Immediately:
 - why am I getting "voltage_ac_l1=167772.146V" and "current_ac_l1=16777.216A" on all three phases?
 - why is model '(null)'?

Then:
 - Add functionality to log collected information to a MongoDB database

Later:
 - Convert to C++?
 - Clean up
 - Use external libs like Boost to make code more concise
